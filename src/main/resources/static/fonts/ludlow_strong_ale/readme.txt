Hey there everyone. Here we have somewhat of a marriage between styles. Cool craft beer or Olde English? It even works in a seafood restaurant environment. My original project was
entitled King James and it was mistakedly released. This version includes kerning and a bit more punctuation. This, like some of my other fonts, is decorative and not meant for full
 punctuation set. This font is free for personal use only. For commercial use please contact me at dennis@sharkshock.net to discuss an end user license.
